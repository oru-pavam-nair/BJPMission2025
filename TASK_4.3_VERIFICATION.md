# Task 4.3 Verification: Redesign Target Modal Layout

## Task Requirements
- Restructure target data display to prevent text overlap
- Implement responsive table design with proper spacing
- Add clear visual hierarchy for different data sections
- _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 4.2, 4.3_

## Implementation Verification

### ✅ Restructure target data display to prevent text overlap

**Implementation:**
- Added proper text truncation with `max-w-[120px] sm:max-w-none truncate` classes
- Used `title` attribute for full text on hover
- Implemented sticky positioning for area names to prevent horizontal scroll issues
- Proper z-index layering to prevent overlap with other elements

**Evidence:**
- Text truncation classes applied to district names
- Sticky left positioning for area column
- Proper spacing between columns with `px-2` and `px-3 sm:px-6`

### ✅ Implement responsive table design with proper spacing

**Implementation:**
- Horizontal scroll container with `overflow-x-auto` for mobile devices
- Responsive padding: `px-3 sm:px-6` for larger screens
- Mobile scroll indicator: "← Swipe to see more data →"
- Proper table structure with `min-w-full` and responsive breakpoints
- Consistent cell padding and spacing throughout

**Evidence:**
- Mobile-optimized table container with overflow handling
- Responsive padding classes throughout the component
- Mobile scroll indicator for user guidance
- Proper table structure with divide classes for visual separation

### ✅ Add clear visual hierarchy for different data sections

**Implementation:**
- **Header Hierarchy:**
  - Main headers (Panchayat, Municipality, Corporation) with proper styling
  - Sub-headers (Total, Win, Opp) with smaller text and muted colors
  - Sticky header positioning for better navigation

- **Data Hierarchy:**
  - District names in bold with `font-medium text-slate-100`
  - Color coding: Green for wins (`text-green-400`), Red for opposition (`text-red-400`)
  - Grand Total row with distinct styling (`bg-slate-800/50 border-t-2`)
  - Hover states for better interactivity

- **Visual Elements:**
  - Legend with color indicators for Win/Opposition
  - Proper background colors and borders for visual separation
  - Consistent spacing and typography scale

**Evidence:**
- Clear header structure with colspan grouping
- Color-coded data for easy scanning
- Distinct Grand Total row styling
- Interactive hover states
- Legend for color coding explanation
